# random-walks

The goal of this project was to simulate random walks in random environments in order to make conjectures about their limiting distributions. Simulations were intially developed in MATLAB and then rewritten in C++ for improved performance. MATLAB was then used to visualize the data and detect patterns through a series of normalizations and statistical tests.
